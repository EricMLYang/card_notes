# GenAI Ecosystem

## Meta

- “They're taking a play that we talked about, which makes a ton of sense, which is it's not a core market, but it's very important. The core money-making market for them is monetizing their family of apps, and so they're scorching the earth for these new markets so that the economics are not viable, which will, I think, allow a more robust ecosystem where they'll have more of a say. Because I think up until this point, you could have said that they and Google were sort of lagging behind OpenAI, but I don't think that's the case.”





I think that Google will open source their models because the most important thing that Google can do is reinforce the value of search. And the best way to do that is to scorch the earth with these models, which is to make them widely available and as free as possible. That will cause Microsoft to have to catch up and that will cause Facebook to have to really look in the mirror and decide whether they're going to cap the betting that they've made on ARVR and reallocate very aggressively to AI.



“That should be what Facebook does. And the reason is if Facebook and Google and Microsoft have roughly the same capability and the same model, there's an element of machine learning called reinforcement learning. And specifically, it's reinforcement learning from human feedback.

Facebook has an enormous amount of reinforcement learning inside of Facebook. Every click, every comment, every like, every share, the huge companies will create the substrates. And I think they'll be forced to scorch the earth and give it away for free.”





“It's probably also pretty bad for one institution to have an AI that is way more powerful than everyone else's AI. And I kind of think that a world where AI is very widely deployed in a way where it's gotten hardened progressively over time and is one where all the different systems will be in check in a way that seems like it is fundamentally more healthy to me than one where this is more concentrated.”



“That's why that model is so popular. So it puts the closed models on their heels because if you can't both train and deploy iteratively and quickly enough, these open-source alternatives will win. And as a result, the economic potential that you have to monetize those models will not be there.”





“I would say the analogy for Google is Android, where Google open sourced the Android operating system because the handset manufacturers and some of the big software companies, so Nokia and Microsoft in particular, Blackberry, had these closed proprietary operating systems, and then the telcos put their apps on and made money and basically had control over whether or not people could access Google and Google services through their phone. So the intention with open sourcing Android was to make sure that Google was not disadvantaged in their core business over time. I think that there's a similar analogy here that by open sourcing these models, they limit competition because VCs are no longer going to plow half a billion dollars into a foundational model development company.”
