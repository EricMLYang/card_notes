Every **whiteboard** is a thinking space for you. You can think of it as an infinite desktop where you can place cards.

The purpose of a whiteboard is **to help you learn or research a topic you care about**. You can create many different whiteboards to research different topics, and these whiteboards will collectively form your knowledge map.
