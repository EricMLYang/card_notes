# [Mindmap](https://wiki.heptabase.com/mindmap): Effortlessly map out your learning.

If you have a clear hierarchical structure in the topic you are learning or researching, consider using a mindmap to take notes. While mindmaps have less flexibility in layout compared to placing cards on a whiteboard, they have a unique advantage: you can quickly and easily adjust the layout of the mindmap by dragging nodes.

## **How to use mindmaps**

At Heptabase, there are two ways to use mindmaps. The first way is to right-click on an empty space on the whiteboard and choose the "Mindmap" option to create it.

By default, each node in a mindmap is a single-line text node. You can create sibling nodes using `Enter`, create child nodes using `Tab`, and use the arrow keys to navigate between nodes. This type of text-based mindmap is useful for quickly brainstorming a topic or organizing notes during classes or while watching videos.

Although text-based mind maps are useful, Heptabase has a unique advantage compared to traditional mind maps: cards can also be mindmap nodes!

When you want to turn a text node into a card and add it to your Card Library, you can right-click on it and select "Turn into new card".

If you want to add an existing card to a mind map, simply drag it onto the desired node, and the card will be attached, becoming a new node in the mindmap.

If you want to create a new mindmap centered around a specific card, just right-click on the card and open the switch for mindmap mode, and you can start adding sub-nodes to it.

Compared to text-based mindmaps, card-based mindmaps can carry more knowledge and help you better understand the structure of the topic you are learning. Mindmaps are no longer just used for brainstorming but can actually become a part of your knowledge management!
