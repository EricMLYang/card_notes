## **[A Simple IoT Framework for Product Managers](https://www.pragmaticinstitute.com/resources/articles/product/a-simple-iot-framework-for-product-managers/)**

- IoT products are more complex than your average product since you need to consider the complexity of five layers of technology:

   - device hardware

   - device software

   - communications

   - cloud platform

   - cloud applications.

- You need to

   - make critical business and technical decisions at *each* of these five layers

   - make sure this myriad of decisions is consistent with your overall strategy and consistent across the five layers. 

   - This exponentially increases the difficulty of managing an IoT product.

- IoT Decision Framework focuses on six key decision areas you need to consider for any IoT product

   - UX

   - Data

   - Business

   - Technology

   - Security

   - Standards & Regulations
