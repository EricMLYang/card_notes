# A card can be placed in multiple whiteboards at the same time. 

At Heptabase, a card can be placed in multiple whiteboards at the same time. For example, the "Einstein" card can be placed in both the "History of Science" and "World War II" whiteboards, just like how our brain works - the same concept or knowledge can be reused under different topics.

When you find a card in the Card Library, you can see in the card’s Info section which whiteboards the card appears on. If you click on a whiteboard name, it will automatically open the whiteboard and focus on the location of the card, allowing you to easily recall the thinking context of the card.

Heptabase's whiteboard offers many advanced features to assist you in learning, including creating sections for multiple cards, organizing cards into mindmaps, creating nested whiteboards within the whiteboard, and more. We will introduce these features in the advanced tutorials.
