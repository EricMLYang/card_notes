# Product Roadmaps Relaunched

## What is the product roadmaps

- **In our view, a product roadmap describes how you intend to achieve your product vision.**

   - *It focuses on the value you propose to deliver to your customer and your organization in order to rally support and coordinate effort among stakeholders.*

   - It’s that simple. And that simplicity is critical to success. Remember, however, that simple does not always equal easy.

- **A product roadmap should:**

   - **Put the organization’s plans in a strategic context**

   - **Focus on delivering value to customers and the organization**

   - **Embrace learning as part of a successful product development process**

   - **Rally the organization around a single set of priorities**

   - **Get customers excited about the product’s direction**

- **At the same time, a product roadmap should not:**

   - **Make promises product teams aren’t confident they will deliver on**

   - **Require a wasteful process of up-front design and estimation**

   - **Be conflated with a project plan or a release plan (we cannot stress this enough)**

# Components of a Roadmap

- Every roadmap is different, and exactly what yours looks like will depend on what you are trying to communicate and to whom. There’s no template or boilerplate you can plug-and-play for roadmap greatness, and a standardized roadmap doesn’t work across all organizations.

- **It needs to tell the story of what it will be like when you achieve your vision, what it will take to get there, and how you will know if you are making progress.**

- The primary components for any product roadmap

   - **Product vision**

   - **Business objectives**

   - **Themes**

   - **Timeframes**

   - **Disclaimer**

- Secondary components to answer the concerns of certain stakeholders

   - **Features and solutions**

   - **Confidence**

   - **Stage of development**

   - **Target customers**

   - **Product areas**
