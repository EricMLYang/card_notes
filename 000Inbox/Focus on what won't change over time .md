Focus on what won't change over time 

Jeff Bezos famously stated in a 2012 interview: "I very frequently get the question: 'What's going to change in the next 10 years?' And that is a very interesting 1  question; it's a very common one. I almost never get the question: 'What's not going to change in the next 10 years?' And I submit to you that that second question is actually the more important of the two -- because you can build a business strategy around the things that are stable in time. ... \[I\]n our retail business, we know that customers want low prices, and I know that's going to be true 10 years from now. They want fast delivery; they want vast selection. It's impossible to imagine a future 10 years from now where a customer comes up and says, 'Jeff I love Amazon; I just wish the prices were a little higher,' \[or\] 'I love Amazon; I just wish you'd deliver a little more slowly.' Impossible." 







this philosophy articulated by Jeff Bezos in 2012 remains a core part of Amazon's business strategy. The focus on what won't change over time (low prices, fast delivery, and vast selection) continues to guide Amazon's approach to retail.

This strategy has proven effective because it allows Amazon to make long-term investments in capabilities and infrastructure that serve these unchanging customer desires. For example:

Low prices: Amazon continues to leverage economies of scale, efficient operations, and the marketplace model to keep prices competitive.

Fast delivery: Amazon has expanded its fulfillment network dramatically with more warehouses, delivery stations, and transportation capabilities to enable faster delivery options (same-day, one-day, and two-day shipping).

Vast selection: Amazon has grown its first-party inventory while also expanding its third-party marketplace, now offering hundreds of millions of products.

These principles remain central to Amazon's business model because they represent fundamental customer preferences that haven't changed. Rather than chasing trends, Amazon invests heavily in improving these core aspects of its service.

This "what won't change" philosophy has been referenced by Amazon leadership in annual shareholder letters and other communications over the years, indicating its continued relevance to their strategic thinking.
