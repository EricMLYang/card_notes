- For a comprehensive understanding of context learning with large language models (LLMs), several key articles provide valuable insights.

   

   1\. \*\*"Can Large Language Models Understand Context?"\*\* by Zhu et al. (2024) discusses the importance of contextual understanding in LLMs. The study introduces a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' ability to comprehend contextual features, which is crucial for effective language processing. The research highlights that while LLMs show impressive capabilities, there is still room for improvement in understanding nuanced context \[\[❞\]\](https://aclanthology.org/2024.findings-eacl.135/).

   

   2\. \*\*"Learning to Retrieve In-Context Examples for Large Language Models"\*\* by Wang et al. (2024) presents a novel framework for enhancing in-context learning by training dense retrievers to identify high-quality examples. The study demonstrates that using a reward model to evaluate and select examples significantly boosts the performance of LLMs across various tasks, showcasing the importance of example quality in context learning \[\[❞\]\](https://aclanthology.org/2024.eacl-long.105/).

   

   3\. \*\*"In-Context Learning Enables Multimodal Large Language Models to Classify Cancer Pathology Images"\*\* by researchers at ar5iv.org explores the application of in-context learning in medical image classification. The study shows how LLMs can adapt to multimodal tasks, such as interpreting medical images, by leveraging contextual information from prompts. This highlights the versatility of LLMs in applying contextual learning to diverse fields \[\[❞\]\](https://ar5iv.org/abs/2403.07407).

   

   These articles collectively illustrate the advancements and challenges in context learning with LLMs, emphasizing the critical role of high-quality contextual examples and benchmarks in enhancing model performance across different applications. For further reading, you can access these articles through their respective publishers: ACL Anthology and ar5iv.org.
