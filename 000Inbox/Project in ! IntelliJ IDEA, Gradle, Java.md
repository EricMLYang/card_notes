## \[ Gradle \]

- What is Gradle:

   - Gradle is a build tool for managing and automating tasks like compiling code, running tests, packaging applications, and managing dependencies in your project.

   - `build.gradle` is very similar to `package.json` in the JavaScript/Node.js ecosystem. Here's a similar points:

      - Dependencies management

      - Scripts/Tasks

      - Project metadata

      - Development tools configuration

   - The main difference is that `build.gradle` is more powerful in terms of build configuration and can handle more complex build scenarios, especially for compiled languages like Java. But conceptually, they serve very similar purposes in their respective ecosystems!

- Gradle wrapper (gradlew) script:

   - This is a POSIX shell script that serves as a Gradle wrapper, allowing you to run Gradle tasks without having Gradle installed on your system. It's generated by Gradle itself.

   - POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface) is a set of standardized specifications defined by the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) to maintain compatibility between operating systems. It defines how applications should interact with the operating system in terms of interface and behavior.
