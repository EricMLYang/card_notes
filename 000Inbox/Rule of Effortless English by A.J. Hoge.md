# Rule of Effortless English by A.J. Hoge

### 1\. **Learn with Your Ears, Not with Your Eyes**

- Spend most of their learning time listening to English to develop a natural understanding of the language

### 2\. **Don't Study Grammar Rules**

- Don’t focusing too much on traditional grammar rules. it can slow down learning and make speaking less natural. Instead, learning grammar intuitively through exposure.

### 3\. **Learn Deeply**

- Deep learning involves repeating and reviewing lessons or materials multiple times until they are fully internalized. This approach helps to ensure that what is learned becomes a permanent part of the student's language ability.

### 4\. **Use Real English Materials**

- Using real-world materials, such as podcasts, movies, and conversations, rather than textbooks. These sources provide natural and authentic language examples.

### 5\. **Focus on Phrases, Not Individual Words**

- Learning phrases or chunks of language rather than isolated words helps learners understand how words are used in context, making it easier to speak fluently.

### 6\. **Listen and Answer, Not Listen and Repeat**

- Encourages active listening by asking learners to listen to questions and then think of their own answers, rather than just repeating what they hear. This helps to develop spontaneous speaking skills.

### 7\. **Learn with Stories**

- Using stories is a central part of Hoge's teaching method. He suggests listening to and creating stories to learn vocabulary, grammar, and speaking skills in a more engaging and memorable way.

### 8\. **Practice Shadowing**

- Shadowing involves listening to spoken English and simultaneously trying to speak along with the audio. This technique helps with pronunciation, rhythm, and fluency.

### 9\. **Relax and Enjoy the Learning Process**

- Hoge believes that being relaxed and having fun while learning is essential. Stress and pressure can hinder the ability to absorb and use new language effectively.

### 10\. **Learn Everyday**

- Consistency is key in language learning. Hoge advises practicing English every day, even if it's just for a short period, to keep the language fresh and continuously improve.

### 11\. **Use the Point of View (POV) Technique**

- This method involves listening to the same story told in different tenses or perspectives (e.g., past, present, future). It helps learners understand and use grammar naturally.

### 12\. **Focus on Real Conversations**

- Hoge suggests that learners should engage in real conversations with native speakers or fellow learners to practice and improve their speaking skills in realistic settings.
