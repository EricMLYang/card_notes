Don't be depressed about GPT-5....

Different models work for different use-cases and GPT-5 works exceptionally well for some of them.

Vibe coding - Sonnet/Opus (hands-down)
Debugging - Sonnet/GPT-5 is OK-ish
Deep Research - GPT-5 
Real-time - Grok-4
Images -  GPT image
Video  - Seadance / Veo-3
OCR - Gemini Flash
Cheap coder - Qwen coder

That said, we need o3 and GPT-4o back.  GPT-5 DOES NOT REPLACE 4o
