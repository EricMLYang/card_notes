A card is your note, as well as a container for knowledge and ideas. You can type `/` to add any types of blocks you want: headings, lists, to-dos, toggles, tables, images, audio, videos, files, PDFs, code snippets, math equations, and dates.

When learning a new topic, you may create cards with just a few sentences, each describing an important concept. However, as you delve deeper into your learning, you may find yourself creating cards with longer content, some even resembling articles or documents.
