# **Tag**

**Tags** are a classification system that groups similar cards and assigns properties to them.

For example, let's say you have a meeting every week. You can create a tag **\#meetings** and add it to all the cards containing meeting notes. Additionally, you can add properties such as "date" and "conclusion" for all cards under the **\#meetings** tag.

You might wonder: When should I use tags and when should I use whiteboards to organize cards?

The answer is simple: tags can be used to describe an **is-a-relationship** (e.g., Card A is a **\#meeting**, Card B is a **\#blog-article**, Card C is a **\#user-research**, Card D is a **\#scientist**), while whiteboards are used to describe topics (e.g., Whiteboard X is "History of Science," Whiteboard Y is "Company Growth Strategy," Whiteboard Z is "Nuclear Engineering Research").

When you want to organize a set of highly homogeneous cards, you can start by using tags. When you want to learn a topic deeply, you can create a whiteboard and then drag the cards related to that topic onto the whiteboard to connect and think.

For example, you can create tags such as **\#scientists** (Newton, Einstein), **\#physics-theories** (thermodynamics, relativity, quantum mechanics), **\#science-events** (Solvay Conference, first solar eclipse observation), and visualize the relationships between the cards with these tags on the whiteboard of "history of science," helping you better understand and remember the topics you are learning and researching.
