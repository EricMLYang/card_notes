# Whiteboard**s don’t own your cards.**

One unique design of Heptabase is that **whiteboards don’t own your cards.** All the cards belong to the Card Library. 

When you are conducting topic research on a whiteboard, you can import cards from the Card Library and place them on the whiteboard to think. 

You can also create new cards on a whiteboard, and these cards will be directly saved to the Card Library.
