# Stop asking AI to summarise.



Do this instead:



1\. Extract Strategic Insights



"Act like a strategy consultant. Identify the 5 most valuable insights and explain what decisions each one informs."



AI becomes your McKinsey analyst.



2\. Turn Information Into Action



"Translate this into a 5-step plan with clear owners, quick wins, and measurable results."



AI becomes your project manager.



3\. Surface Hidden Assumptions



"Reveal the unstated assumptions or blind spots shaping this argument - and what changes if they're wrong."



AI becomes your devil's advocate.



4\. Compare Opposing Views



"Map this idea against two competing perspectives. Show where they align, where they differ, and which context fits each."



AI becomes your debate moderator.



5\. Distil for a Specific Role



"Filter this through the lens of a \[role\]:



\- Marketer → What drives reach or conversion



\- Founder → What affects cash flow or growth



\- Analyst → What changes the metrics"



AI becomes your specialist advisor.



6\. Build a Reusable Model



"Extract the repeatable framework hidden in this text. Label each stage, its input, and output."



AI becomes your systems architect.



7\. Extract Contrarian Takeaways



"Find insights that would challenge smart peers - still credible, but unexpected. Write each as a sharp one-liner."



AI becomes your thought provocateur.



8\. Identify Leverage Points



"Highlight the 3 leverage points where small actions could create outsized results. Explain why each one matters."



AI becomes your force multiplier.



Most people use 5% of AI's capability.



These prompts unlock the other 95%.



Save this. Your analysis just got smarter.
