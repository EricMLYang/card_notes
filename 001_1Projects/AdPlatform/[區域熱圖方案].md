# 便利商店智慧廣告受眾分析：低成本多感測器融合完整框架

Taiwan's convenience stores are deploying multi-sensor retail media networks combining WiFi probes, IR thermal grids, BLE beacons, and low-cost AI cameras to transform digital signage into data-driven advertising platforms. Research across 7-ELEVEN's 16,000-screen network, emerging sensor fusion technologies, and Taiwan's regulatory landscape reveals that **a $5,000-10,000 per-store investment can generate $8,000-10,000 annual profit through retail media monetization**, with closed-loop attribution proving 4:1-5:1 ROAS to advertisers. The technical feasibility is proven—7-ELEVEN has operated audience analytics at scale since 2011—but success requires sophisticated sensor fusion, strict Taiwan PDPA compliance through differential privacy, and minimum 25-store scale for national brand partnerships.

## Taiwan convenience store leaders demonstrate commercial viability at scale

7-ELEVEN Taiwan operates Asia's most advanced retail media network with **16,000 screens across 6,800+ stores** partnered with Quividi since 2011, proving decade-long commercial sustainability. The Quividi deployment uses computer vision for real-time demographic analysis (gender and seven age classes with 90% accuracy), delivering hourly audience breakdowns without storing personally identifiable data. This privacy-by-design approach provides "substantial sales uplift for promoted products" according to implementation reports, with the 10+ year operation indicating positive ROI. FamilyMart Taiwan recently expanded its retail media strategy through a September 2025 partnership with AnyMind Group, leveraging 4,300 stores and 16 million loyalty members for omnichannel remarketing and data-driven insights.

The unmanned X-Store program reveals Taiwan's technical sophistication in sensor deployment. X-Store 7 at ITRI headquarters uses a sensor-fusion approach combining **smart shelves with weight sensors, infrared light curtain sensors, customer positioning technologies, and ID confirmation systems**—explicitly designed to "significantly reduce computational complexity and camera-related costs compared to capital-intensive computer vision systems." Performance data from X-Store 3 at Kaohsiung University shows **3x customer traffic and 2x sales versus traditional stores**, though Uni-President Group Chair Lo Chih-hsien acknowledges "unmanned stores do not make money" short-term, positioning them as preparation for labor shortages rather than immediate profitability. X-Store 9 at National Central University represents the opposite approach with 140 ceiling-mounted cameras and optical radar for AI image recognition, achieving 30-second checkout without barcode scanning.

Taiwan's vendor ecosystem provides turnkey solutions for mid-market deployments. **DataVan (迪維科, Stock: 3521)** offers modular POS systems, digital signage, and kiosk solutions with customizable "building blocks" design at off-the-shelf prices. **91APP (Stock: 6741)**, Taiwan's first listed SaaS company with $1.7B IPO valuation, provides OMO retail platforms and retail media network solutions serving FamilyMart and 10,000+ brands, achieving 10-12% YoY growth in 2025. The November 2025 acquisition of iCHEF for $32 million expands their reach into F&B with 15,000+ restaurant clients. **Appier** (Tokyo Stock Exchange: 4180), founded in Taipei, delivers AI-powered marketing automation with clients including Carrefour Taiwan and Shiseido Taiwan (47% conversion rate increase). **ITRI's Grab & Go System** offers the most relevant low-cost sensor solution, combining weight sensors and IR curtains for item-level tracking without expensive computer vision infrastructure.

## Multi-sensor fusion architecture balances cost, accuracy, and privacy compliance

The technical architecture must reconcile fundamentally different sensor characteristics into unified customer insights. **WiFi probe accuracy ranges 5-15 meters**, critically limited by iOS privacy restrictions (Apple blocks WiFi environment data access) and MAC randomization on iOS 14+ and Android that prevents consistent device tracking. Research indicates the MAC address space (approximately 334 billion addresses with only 39 bits allocated) makes simple hashing vulnerable to rainbow table reversal, requiring computationally expensive hash functions (SHA-256 or Argon2) combined with time-rotating peppers changed daily/weekly, device-specific salts, and truncation to 24-32 bits for k-anonymity. **BLE beacon accuracy reaches 2-3 meters with triangulation from multiple beacons**, classified into zones: immediate (<0.6-1m), near (1-8m ±1.5m fluctuation), and far (10-40m). Detection latency runs 3-6 seconds with signals blocked by metal, water, and human bodies, requiring 2-3 beacons per station mounted 2.5+ meters high with 1-2 year battery life.

**IR thermal grids** using common hardware like AMG8833 (8×8 pixels, 10 Hz, ±0.08°C accuracy) or MLX90640 (32×24 pixels, ±1°C accuracy) provide privacy-preserving occupancy detection with >98% accuracy in normal conditions, declining with thick winter clothing. The low resolution requires bicubic interpolation, background subtraction, and blob detection post-processing, with accuracy decreasing by distance and sensitivity to heat sources like sunlight and HVAC. **Low-cost facial recognition cameras** deployed at edge achieve 99%+ accuracy with proper lighting and <5ms recognition time, storing 10,000 face profiles with fanless low-power processors. Edge computing reduces bandwidth by 7x and eliminates cloud round-trip latency, but requires higher upfront hardware costs versus cloud solutions and faces reduced accuracy compared to enterprise server-based systems.

Sensor fusion requires addressing three critical synchronization challenges. **Timestamp alignment** across heterogeneous sensors operating at different frequencies (WiFi probes at 3-second Android throttling, IR thermal at 10 Hz, beacons with 3-6 second latency, cameras at 30 fps) demands GPS/UTC hardware sync signals for millisecond accuracy or watermarking in Spark Streaming with 10-minute tolerance windows. **Spatial coordinate transformation** converts each sensor's local reference frame to a common global coordinate system through rotation matrices and translation vectors stored in sensor configuration databases. **Confidence-weighted fusion** combines positioning estimates from multiple sensors by calculating per-sensor confidence scores and weighting contributions proportionally:

```
def fuse_positioning_sensors(wifi_data, beacon_data, thermal_data):
    total_confidence = (wifi_confidence + beacon_confidence + 
                       thermal_confidence)
    x = (wifi_data.x * wifi_confidence + 
         beacon_data.x * beacon_confidence + 
         thermal_data.x * thermal_confidence) / total_confidence
    return Position(x, y, total_confidence / 3)

```

The recommended architecture follows **Kappa streaming pattern with Databricks Medallion layers** rather than Lambda's dual batch/speed architecture, as modern Delta Lake supports both real-time and historical reprocessing from same stream with single codebase. Apache Kafka provides superior flexibility over AWS Kinesis with millisecond latency, unlimited retention (versus Kinesis's 7-day maximum), and lower cost at scale, though requiring more operational management. Spark Structured Streaming processes micro-batches every 5-30 seconds for near real-time analytics while balancing throughput and cost, with expected per-store throughput of 1,000-5,000 events/second from all sensors combined.

## Databricks medallion architecture transforms raw sensor data into business intelligence

The **Bronze layer** lands all sensor data "as-is" with append-only auditability, capturing raw events with ingestion timestamps, source system IDs, and batch IDs for change data capture. Critical schema design for bronze.wifi_probe_raw includes event_timestamp, ingestion_timestamp, device_mac_address (immediately hashed before storage), access_point_id, rssi_value, and source_system_id. The bronze.beacon_events_raw schema captures beacon_uuid, major/minor identifiers, proximity_category (immediate/near/far), and rssi_value. For bronze.thermal_sensor_raw, store temperature_matrix as array<array<float>> representing the 8×8 or 32×24 pixel grid, along with ambient_temperature and frame_number. The [bronze.camera](bronze.camera)\_events_raw schema includes face_detected boolean, anonymized face_id, confidence_score, age_estimate, gender_estimate (all nullable), and location_zone—critically, raw images never reach this layer due to edge processing.

The **Silver layer** provides enterprise-cleaned, conformed data with "just-enough" cleansing emphasizing speed and self-service analytics. The silver.device_positions table unifies multi-sensor positioning data with columns for device_id (hashed), position_x/y (global coordinates), floor_level, zone_id, positioning_method (wifi/beacon/fusion), accuracy_meters, data_quality_score, and is_valid boolean. Data validation in Silver implements comprehensive checks:

```
df_validated = df.withColumn("is_valid",
  when(
    (col("rssi_value").between(-100, 0)) &
    (col("event_timestamp").isNotNull()) &
    (col("device_mac").rlike("^([0-9A-Fa-f]{2}:){5}[0-9A-Fa-f]{2}$"))
  , True).otherwise(False))

```

Silver.occupancy_events aggregates zone-level counts from multiple sensor types with occupancy_count, detection_method, confidence_score, and movement_detected boolean. Silver.customer_interactions reconstructs individual sessions by connecting zone detections chronologically, storing session_start_timestamp, zones_visited array, and dwell_times_seconds map<string, integer> for each zone.

The **Gold layer** delivers consumption-ready analytics optimized for specific business use cases. [Gold.store](Gold.store)\_traffic_hourly aggregates metrics by date_hour, store_id, and zone_id, calculating unique_visitors (from hashed MAC counts), total_visits, avg_dwell_time_minutes, peak_occupancy, and conversion_rate (requires POS integration). Gold.customer_journey provides path analysis with path_sequence array showing zone progression, zones_visited count, products_viewed array (from shelf sensors), purchase_made boolean, and total_spent decimal. Gold.heatmap_analytics enables visualization with x_coordinate, y_coordinate, traffic_intensity float, and avg_dwell_seconds aggregated hourly.

**Delta Lake features** critical for this architecture include ACID transactions preventing data corruption during concurrent writes, time travel for debugging and regulatory compliance (enabling audit trails), schema enforcement preventing bad data insertion, schema evolution with mergeSchema option for adding columns dynamically, upsert/merge operations for handling late-arriving sensor data, and streaming/batch unification serving both workloads from same tables. Partition strategy should use date/hour/store_id for query performance, with Z-ordering on frequently filtered columns like zone_id and device_id.

## Audience profiling techniques extract actionable insights from limited sensor data

Demographic analysis from low-cost facial recognition uses **68-point facial landmark detection with deep CNN architectures** (filter sizes 32→512, dropout 0.5) trained on datasets like Adience and UTK Faces, achieving age estimation within ±4.5 years and gender detection >95% accuracy in <1 second processing time. The critical privacy-preserving implementation performs all analysis on edge cameras, extracting only aggregate metrics (counts, average age range, gender distribution, emotion detection across six universal emotions) while immediately deleting processed frames. Output categorizes age into eight buckets (0-2, 4-6, 8-13, 15-20, 25-32, 38-43, 48-53, 60+) matching Quividi's seven age class system, with attention metrics tracking gaze direction and dwell time for engagement scoring.

**WiFi analytics** enables anonymous longitudinal tracking through MAC address hashing with carefully designed privacy protections. The robust hashing approach applies SHA-256 to MAC + device_salt + time_pepper_part1 + time_pepper_part2, then truncates to 24-32 bits accepting <1% collision rate for k-anonymity. Time-rotating peppers changed every minute prevent cross-session tracking while maintaining same-day repeat visitor identification. This methodology captures key behavioral metrics: footfall (total unique visitors via anonymized MACs), dwell time (average in-store duration overall and by zone), visit frequency (first-time versus repeat visitor rates), and traffic patterns (peak hours, flow sequences, zone popularity). First-time visitor return rate calculates (Returning First-Time Visitors / Total First-Time Visitors) × 100, while churn rate applies ML-based prediction on visit frequency trends and recency patterns.

Inferring individual behavior from zone-level sensors requires sophisticated path reconstruction algorithms. The data fusion approach combines WiFi zones providing room-level accuracy (5-15m), IR thermal sensors providing precise occupancy counts and density, beacon triggers providing 3-foot accuracy proximity detection, and camera analytics providing path visualization and directional movement. The path reconstruction algorithm detects device entry through WiFi probe requests, tracks zone transitions through WiFi AP handoffs combined with beacon proximity changes, correlates with IR beam breaks for entry/exit confirmations, enriches with video path tracking for visual validation, synchronizes timestamps across all sensors, and outputs sequential zone visits with dwell times. Research demonstrates **1% increase in dwell time correlates with 1.3% sales increase** (Pathintelligence study), making dwell time analysis directly actionable for layout optimization.

**Repeat visitor identification** uses persistent MAC hashes as anonymous identifiers, enabling behavioral profiling across visits without knowing device owners. Hash rotation policies (daily/weekly pepper changes) limit tracking windows for privacy while building anonymous profiles capturing visit frequency (segmented as 1st visit, 2-5 visits, 5+ visits, loyal customers), preferred zones, dwell patterns, and time between visits. No linkage to personally identifiable information occurs unless customers opt in through app login or loyalty program enrollment, with all reporting aggregated at cohort level preventing individual tracking.

## Attribution models connect advertising exposure to measurable purchase outcomes

Multi-touch attribution surpasses single-touch models for retail media where customer journeys involve multiple exposures across touchpoints. **First-touch attribution** credits the initial interaction, measuring awareness and discovery campaign effectiveness but ignoring mid-funnel and bottom-funnel contributions. **Last-touch attribution** credits the final interaction before purchase, simplifying direct response measurement but over-crediting lower-funnel activities while ignoring the customer journey buildup. **Multi-touch linear attribution** distributes credit equally across all touchpoints, while **time-decay attribution** weights recent interactions more heavily. **Position-based (U-shaped) attribution** allocates 40% to first touch, 40% to last touch, and 20% distributed across middle touches, recognizing that awareness and conversion moments carry special significance. **Data-driven algorithmic attribution** applies machine learning to determine credit distribution based on actual conversion patterns, requiring substantial data volume but delivering most accurate insights.

The convenience store environment enables uniquely powerful **closed-loop attribution** linking ad exposure → product consideration → purchase within minutes or hours rather than days or weeks. Implementation follows five stages: (1) Campaign activation embeds tracking parameters (campaign ID, content variant) in digital signage content, (2) Exposure tracking uses computer vision to log Opportunity to See (OTS) and attention metrics while WiFi/beacons log presence and zone entry with timestamp + anonymous ID, (3) Behavioral tracking captures zone dwell times and path to product with interaction logging where shelf sensors exist, (4) Transaction capture records POS purchases with time/location matched to exposure data for probabilistic attribution, (5) Analysis and optimization calculates campaign performance (ROAS, lift, incrementality) and creative effectiveness for budget reallocation.

**Sales lift analysis** quantifies incremental impact: Sales Lift % = (Sales During Campaign - Baseline Sales) / Baseline Sales × 100, then Attributed Revenue = Sales Lift × Average Transaction Value, finally ROAS = Attributed Revenue / Ad Spend. Industry benchmarks show **13-17% sales lift** typical for in-store digital campaigns, with a battery brand case study achieving 13.5% lift and 10% transaction growth over four weeks. DOOH gas station campaign delivered 17% lift with 46% new-to-brand customers and $5.37 ROAS. Convenience store dwell time of 3-7 minutes combined with checkout captive audience of 2-5 minutes provides high-quality exposure windows, with research showing 51% who saw DOOH with directions visited the business and 93% of visitors purchased.

**Incrementality testing** establishes causation rather than correlation through controlled experiments. Geo-based holdout compares test markets (campaign runs) versus control markets (no campaign/holdout) with sales difference representing incremental lift, requiring demographically and historically similar markets. Audience-based control randomly assigns 50% exposed and 50% suppressed within same market, though preventing contamination between groups challenges implementation. Time-based experiments alternate on/off periods requiring careful seasonality controls. Synthetic controls use machine learning to create virtual control groups with characteristics matching exposed groups, enabling post-campaign comparison of actual performance versus predicted no-ad scenario. Best practices require minimum 14-day test duration accounting for purchase cycles, 95% statistical confidence thresholds, upfront sample size calculations, and controls for external factors including holidays, promotions, and weather.

**POS integration** closes the attribution loop through three architectural patterns. Real-time API integration flows transaction data from POS system to analytics platform via REST APIs enabling live dashboards and immediate attribution. Batch processing exports end-of-day POS data through ETL pipelines suitable for historical analysis and overnight reporting. Cloud data warehousing (Snowflake, BigQuery) combines POS data with WiFi analytics, ad exposure, and customer profiles for advanced analytics and ML models. Anonymous linking without PII uses time-window attribution (WiFi MAC hash detected within same time window as POS transaction creates probabilistic match if only one transaction occurred), basket composition matching (digital signage shows specific product, POS basket contains that product plus complementary items matching signature basket pattern), zone-based attribution (device path through zones to advertised product correlates with POS scan within minutes), and aggregated store-level analysis (total ad impressions versus total sales of advertised item with lift measurement versus non-advertised periods or control stores).

## Taiwan PDPA compliance requires differential privacy and explicit consent protocols

Taiwan's Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA), amended May 31, 2023, classifies **facial recognition data as sensitive personal data** (physical characteristics) requiring one of four legal grounds: expressly required by law, necessary for public interest, explicit consent from data subject, or data already made public by subject. For retail analytics, explicit consent represents the primary viable path, requiring informing data subjects of purpose, scope, usage impact, and data subject rights (access, deletion, objection) with separate consent needed for uses beyond original purpose. Penalties range NT$2M-15M for security breaches, up to NT$200K for marketing violations, enforced by the Preparatory Office of Personal Data Protection Commission with extraterritorial reach applying to entities outside Taiwan collecting data of Taiwan nationals.

**Simple MAC address hashing fails PDPA anonymization standards** because the MAC address space of only \~334 billion addresses (39 bits allocated, 50% enumerable in 31 bits) enables rainbow table reversal, as explicitly warned by the FTC. The robust PDPA-compliant approach implements six layers: (1) secret pepper split between sensor and central server, (2) time-rotating peppers changed daily/weekly preventing long-term tracking, (3) salted hashing with per-device random salt, (4) computationally expensive hash function (SHA-256 minimum, Argon2 or PBKDF2 preferred), (5) truncation to 24-32 bits for k-anonymity accepting <1% collision rate, (6) immediate processing with original MAC address discarded before storage. Formula: HASH(MAC + device_salt + time_pepper_part1 + time_pepper_part2) → Truncate to 24-32 bits.

**Differential privacy** represents the gold standard for anonymization, satisfying GDPR, CCPA, and PDPA requirements through mathematical guarantees. The framework adds calibrated noise to data or query results controlled by privacy budget epsilon (ε), with typical values ε = 0.1-1.0 for strong privacy (lower ε = stronger privacy but less accuracy). Key properties include withstanding linkage, differential, and reconstruction attacks; compositional privacy enabling calculation of cumulative privacy loss; and impossibility of determining if specific individual exists in dataset. Adopted by Google, Apple, U.S. Census, Snowflake, and BigQuery, differential privacy applications in retail include Customer 360 analytics, cross-outlet behavior analysis, supply chain benchmarking, and aggregated purchase insights.

**Edge processing for video analytics** provides the most privacy-preserving architecture by processing facial recognition and analytics on camera devices, extracting only needed metrics (count, dwell time, demographics) while never transmitting or storing raw images. Under PDPA interpretation, if output remains non-identifiable, it may not constitute "personal data" triggering regulatory requirements. Implementation deploys AI models on edge cameras outputting aggregate counts, average age ranges, and gender distributions while deleting processed frames immediately, transmitting only anonymized statistics to cloud systems. Data minimization, a core PDPA principle requiring processing not exceed necessary scope of specific purposes, mandates collecting only essential data points, immediate deletion of unnecessary fields, storing aggregated insights rather than raw data, and time-limited retention (24-72 hours for granular data).

Compliance checklist for deployment includes pre-deployment requirements (legal ground established, specific purpose documented, data minimization plan, consent mechanism designed, privacy notice prepared, security measures implemented, vendor PDPA compliance verified, retention policy defined, cross-border transfer reviewed), facial recognition specific requirements (sensitive data legal ground documented, edge processing implemented, anonymization at source with no raw image storage, explicit consent obtained, opt-out mechanism provided, children's data protection ensured), WiFi tracking requirements (robust MAC hashing with salted, peppered, time-rotating keys, hash before storage never storing raw MAC, time-limited tracking, aggregation only with no individual patterns, signage posted, opt-out method available), and operational requirements (transparency notices posted in-store, staff trained on data handling, data subject rights procedures for access/deletion/objection, breach response plan with 72-hour notification capability, activity logs maintained, regular compliance audits, vendor contracts including PDPA obligations).

## Retail media network economics justify investment with proven ROAS benchmarks

The global retail media network market reached **$119.4B in 2024 with projections to $100B+ by 2026** (BCG) representing 25% annual CAGR and 25%+ digital advertising share, with 60-70% representing net new spending rather than shifted trade dollars. Amazon Ads dominates with 75% US market share and $60B+ projected 2025 revenue (48% YoY growth), while Walmart Connect grows 50% YoY contributing 12% of total Walmart profits. Kroger Precision Marketing serves 2,700+ stores and 60M households with 96% transaction capture via loyalty program, delivering 13% engagement increase. This market transformation breaks Meta/Google duopoly through first-party data advantages, closed-loop attribution capabilities, and privacy-compliant targeting without cookies.

**Pricing benchmarks** establish retail media premium over traditional DOOH. CPM ranges **$20-50** (McKinsey benchmark, average $35 target) compared to CTV $20-50, Facebook $9.06, and traditional DOOH $5-20. CPC averages **$0.90-$1.10** (Q3 2022: $0.90, Q4 2023: $1.10 showing declining trend) versus Facebook $0.51 and LinkedIn $5.61. CPA varies by category: Automotive $78, Electronics $76, Beauty $61, Grocery $53. **ROAS benchmarks of 4:1 to 5:1** ($4-5 revenue per $1 spent) represent industry standard, with McKinsey reporting 70% of marketers see better returns from retail media versus other platforms, high-value products achieving 10:1+, and minimum profitable threshold at 2:1.

The premium pricing versus traditional DOOH justifies through five differentiation factors. **First-party data targeting** leverages consented loyalty program data versus DOOH's contextual targeting (location, time only). **Closed-loop measurement** provides direct purchase tracking versus DOOH's estimated impressions. **High purchase intent** captures shoppers already buying versus general audience awareness. **Privacy compliance** uses consented data eliminating cookie dependencies. **Superior conversion rates** result from proximity to purchase decision with minutes-to-hours attribution windows versus days-to-weeks for online channels.

**Per-store economics** for convenience store deployment show compelling ROI. Initial hardware investment of $2,000-8,000 per store (2-4 screens, sensors) plus software $200-800/month (analytics, ad serving, CMS) and one-time setup $2,000-8,000 totals $5,000-10,000 initial investment with $200-800 monthly ongoing costs. Revenue potential calculation: 500 daily visitors × 30 days × 10 ad exposures = 150,000 monthly impressions per store, 3 screens × 150,000 = 450,000 impressions/month network-wide, at $30 CPM = $13,500/month gross revenue, at 60% margin = $8,100/month net profit, annual net \~$97,000 per store. **Breakeven occurs 12-24 months** with profitability margins of 50-70% (versus 3-4% traditional retail margins). Minimum viable scale requires 5-10 stores for local/regional brands, 25+ stores for national CPG interest, 100+ stores for major RMN competitiveness, with critical mass at 200,000+ monthly impressions network-wide.

**Data clean rooms** enable privacy-safe collaboration between retailers and brands, creating secure environments where multiple parties analyze combined data without exposing PII. The architecture encrypts/hashes data before entry, runs queries on aggregated data only, outputs anonymized aggregated results exclusively, never extracts raw data, and implements strict access controls with audit logs. Benefits include secure retailer + brand data combination, enhanced targeting matching brand CRM with retailer loyalty data, cross-channel measurement tracking online ad to offline purchase, GDPR/CCPA/PDPA compatibility, advertiser trust that data won't leak, and retailer monetization of data access. Major providers include Amazon Marketing Cloud (AMC), LiveRamp, InfoSum, Habu, Snowflake with differential privacy, and Google BigQuery with Tumult Labs, with 64% using privacy-preserving tech deploying clean rooms and 96% of RMN operators maintaining waiting lists.

## Implementation roadmap balances technical complexity with commercial milestones

**Phase 1 foundation** (months 0-3) establishes single-store pilot deploying 2-3 digital screens (checkout, entrance), WiFi analytics sensors (3-4 units), optional edge processing cameras for facial analytics, and basic analytics dashboard. Investment of $5,000-10,000 initial plus $300-500/month proves technology and gathers baseline metrics for validation before scaling. Critical success factors include achieving >95% sensor uptime, validating demographic accuracy against manual counts, establishing data pipeline reliability, and documenting privacy compliance procedures. Technical milestones include Bronze layer ingestion from all sensors with <5 second latency, Silver layer producing validated device positions with timestamp synchronization ±10 seconds, and Gold layer delivering hourly traffic reports with demographic breakdowns.

**Phase 2 local network** (months 7-18) expands to 5-10 stores standardizing deployment and beginning local advertiser outreach. Revenue target of $20,000-30,000/month network-wide with breakeven at months 12-18 validates business model sustainability. This phase implements cross-store analytics comparing traffic patterns and demographics, deploys A/B testing infrastructure for creative optimization, integrates POS data for closed-loop attribution at aggregated level, and establishes first advertiser partnerships with local/regional brands. Technical complexity increases with multi-store data synchronization, network-wide unique visitor deduplication using consistent MAC hashing, and consolidated reporting dashboards. Sales team development focuses on demonstrating ROAS through pilot campaigns, creating rate card with tiered CPM pricing ($25-35-45), and building campaign management workflows.

**Phase 3 regional scale** (months 19-36) reaches 25-50 stores enabling national CPG brand partnerships through data clean room implementation. Revenue target exceeds $100,000/month with profitability margins of 50-60% as operational efficiency improves. This phase deploys real-time bidding infrastructure for programmatic DOOH, implements predictive analytics for traffic forecasting and inventory optimization, integrates loyalty program data (with consent) for enhanced targeting, and establishes partnerships with retail media platforms and DSPs. Technical architecture matures with Databricks Delta Live Tables for automated data quality, ML models for customer churn prediction and LTV estimation, dynamic creative optimization serving personalized content by demographics, and cross-channel attribution connecting online campaigns to in-store outcomes.

**Phase 4 advanced capabilities** (months 36+) achieves 100+ store network with AI-driven optimization competing with major RMNs. Focus shifts to maximizing yield through automated bidding and budget allocation algorithms, real-time audience segmentation and targeting, synthetic control group generation for incrementality testing, and cross-retailer consortiums for expanded reach. Technical innovation includes federated learning enabling multi-retailer insights without data sharing, edge ML inference serving content decisions <100ms latency, blockchain-based attribution for transparent multi-party verification, and AR/VR experiences for premium advertiser engagements.

**Critical success factors** across all phases include scale velocity (reaching 25+ stores within 18 months for national brand credibility), data quality with accurate footfall counts and demographics validated against ground truth, closed-loop measurement requiring loyalty program integration as essential foundation, transparent privacy practices building consumer trust and regulatory compliance, and strategic partnerships joining or creating retail media consortiums for collective scale and shared technology investments.

**Implementation complexity assessment** identifies high-risk areas requiring specialized expertise. Timestamp synchronization across heterogeneous sensors represents highest technical challenge (3-4 weeks development time), requiring GPS/UTC sync hardware or sophisticated watermarking in streaming pipelines. Sensor fusion algorithms implementing Kalman filtering for movement prediction demand ML engineering skills (4-6 weeks). WiFi MAC randomization reducing tracking effectiveness requires enhanced beacon deployment and thermal sensor correlation. Privacy regulations necessitate legal review and ongoing compliance monitoring. Total MVP timeline spans 4-6 months with team requirements including 2-3 data engineers (Spark, Delta Lake, streaming), 1-2 ML engineers (sensor fusion, Kalman filtering), 1 DevOps engineer (Kafka, cloud infrastructure), 1-2 BI developers (dashboards, business logic), and 1 solutions architect for overall design leadership.

## Conclusion

Taiwan's convenience store market provides proven foundation for low-cost multi-sensor retail media networks, with 7-ELEVEN's decade-long 16,000-screen deployment demonstrating commercial sustainability and FamilyMart's 2025 AnyMind partnership accelerating market maturity. The technical architecture combining WiFi probes (5-15m accuracy, MAC hashing required), IR thermal grids (>98% occupancy detection, privacy-preserving), BLE beacons (2-3m triangulation accuracy), and edge-processing AI cameras (99%+ facial recognition accuracy, no image storage) delivers comprehensive audience analytics through Databricks Medallion layers (Bronze raw ingestion, Silver sensor fusion, Gold business intelligence) with Kappa streaming architecture and Delta Lake ACID guarantees. Attribution frameworks prove 13-17% sales lift with 4:1-5:1 ROAS benchmarks through closed-loop POS integration, while Taiwan PDPA compliance requires differential privacy (ε = 0.1-1.0), edge processing for facial analytics, robust MAC hashing with time-rotating peppers, and explicit consent protocols.

Economic analysis validates investment with $5,000-10,000 per-store deployment generating $8,000-10,000 annual profit at 50-70% margins versus 3-4% traditional retail, breakeven 12-24 months, minimum viable scale 25+ stores for national brand partnerships, and retail media network market growth 25% CAGR to $100B+ by 2026. Taiwan vendors including DataVan (digital signage/POS), 91APP (retail SaaS), Appier (AI marketing), and ITRI (sensor systems) provide local implementation partnerships, while Quividi's proven audience measurement technology and data clean room infrastructure enable privacy-safe brand collaborations. Success depends on aggressive scaling (25+ stores within 18 months), closed-loop attribution via loyalty program integration, transparent PDPA compliance building consumer trust, and data quality exceeding 95% sensor uptime with validated demographic accuracy.

The opportunity lies not in revolutionary technology but disciplined execution—7-ELEVEN已經證明商業模式可行性，ITRI已開發低成本感測器方案，Databricks已提供企業級資料平台，而台灣PDPA的差分隱私要求反而成為建立消費者信任的競爭優勢。關鍵在於25店規模的快速達成、POS封閉迴路歸因的完整建置、以及將隱私合規從成本中心轉化為差異化價值的策略定位。
