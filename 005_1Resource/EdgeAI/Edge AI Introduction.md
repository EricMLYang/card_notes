# Edge AI Introduction

- Edge AI = *embedded machine learning + TinyML*

- All of these devices are embedded systems containing microprocessors that run software written by embedded software engineers. Since they’re at the edge of the network, we can also call them *edge devices*. Performing computation on edge devices is known as *edge computing*.

- The edge isn’t a single place; it’s more like a broad region.

- For instance, modern cellphones are designed to include dedicated low-power digital signal processing hardware so that they can continually listen out for a wake word (such as “OK, Google” or “Hey, Siri”) without draining the battery.

- Why Edge: *Bandwidth, Latency, Economics, Reliability, Privacy*

### The Rabbit R1 assistant utilizes:

- **Operating System:** Rabbit OS, based on the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) version 13. While initially described as "very bespoke AOSP," subsequent analysis suggests it has minimal modifications from the original Android source code.

- **AI Model:** Employs a Large Action Model (LAM), a type of large language model designed to perform actions and assist with tasks like web searches, streaming music, and transportation services.expand_more The LAM is a proprietary model developed by Rabbit Inc.expand_more

**Additional Information:**

- The Rabbit R1 device is designed by Teenage Engineering and runs on Rabbit OS.expand_more

- It is capable of performing various functions using voice commands and touch interaction.expand_more

- The device is currently available for pre-order and is expected to start shipping in early 2024.

Please note that the information regarding the extent of modifications to AOSP in Rabbit OS has been disputed, with some sources suggesting minimal changes while others claim it to be more customized.
