   此部分是專案的「**基本資料卡**」📄。用來快速理解專案的性質、範疇、目標使用者和部署環境，是整個審查的基礎。

- **\## 填寫者**
   **專案經理 (Project Manager, PM)** 主導，並與 **技術負責人 (Tech Lead)** 協作完成。

- **\## 填寫指南**

   - **1\.1.1.1 (Nature of System):** 根據您的方案類型填寫，例如 `Software Package` (套裝軟體)、`Bespoke` (客製化開發) 或 `SaaS` (軟體即服務)。

   - **1\.1.1.2 (Hosting):** 明確指出託管方式 (地端 `On-Premise` 或雲端 `Cloud`) 與具體地點/區域。

   - **1\.1.1.3 (Cloud Provider):** 若是雲端方案，需寫明是哪家雲端服務商 (如 AWS, Azure, GCP)。若非主流廠商，需按要求提供 CAIQ 安全評估問卷。

   - **1\.1.1.6 (Project Type):** 這是**重要分類題**。根據專案預算、戰略重要性、是否面向公眾等標準，判斷專案的監管級別。若符合兩項或以上，通常代表此專案需要更嚴格的治理與審查。

- **\## 注意事項**

   - 這是建立共識的第一步，內容務必**清晰、準確**。

   - 第 `1.1.1.6` 題的答案會直接影響後續的審查嚴謹度與資源投入。

## 5\. 實施方法、技術平台與架構 (Implementation, Technology & Architecture)

- **\## 範疇**
   這是整個檢查表的「**技術核心**」🛠️。詳細描述系統的架構藍圖、採用的技術堆疊、身份驗證機制、開發維運模式 (DevOps) 等。

- **\## 填寫者**
   **技術架構師**與**主要開發人員 (Lead Developer)**。

- **\## 填寫指南**

   - **5\.1.1 (Architecture Diagram):** **必須提供**！一張清晰的架構圖勝過千言萬語。圖中需包含主要元件、伺服器、資料庫、以及與其他系統的資料流向。

   - **5\.2.1 (Mainstream Technology):** 盡可能採用公司內部的主流或標準技術，以降低維護與支援的風險。若採用新技術，需有充分理由並評估支援風險。

   - **5\.4 (Authentication):** 身份驗證是資安重點。應優先整合公司的目錄服務 (如 AD/AAD)，避免各自為政建立帳號系統。

   - **5\.6 (Mobile Application):** 若開發手機 App，需說明為何選擇特定的開發方式 (例如，為何不用 RWA 而要用原生 App)。

   - **5\.7 (DevOps):** 說明是否採用自動化建置與部署 (CI/CD)，以及是否規劃應用程式效能監控 (APM) 和自動化測試。

- **\## 注意事項**

   - **架構圖是溝通的關鍵**，務必確保其準確反映 BOM 和技術選型。

   - 任何偏離公司標準技術的選擇，都需要提出**強而有力的 justification**。

## 6\. 資料敏感性與安全性 (Data Sensitivity and Security)

- **\## 範疇**
   專案的「**安全防護網**」🛡️。確保系統設計從一開始就將資料保護、隱私法規、加密措施與安全測試納入考量。

- **\## 填寫者**
   **技術架構師**與**資安專家 (Security Specialist)**。

- **\## 填寫指南**

   - **6\.1 (Personal Data):** 若處理個資，必須遵循當地的隱私法規 (如 PDPA, GDPR)。需有使用者同意條款 (PICS)，並注意跨境資料傳輸的合規性。

   - **6\.3 (Encryption):** 這是**必做題**。所有敏感資料在靜止 (Data-at-Rest，如存於資料庫) 和傳輸 (Data-in-Transit，如透過網路) 時都**必須加密**。需說明採用的加密技術 (如 TDE, TLS)。

   - **6\.5 (Security Testing):** 根據專案類型 (全新開發/功能增強/套裝軟體)，規劃對應的安全測試：

      - **SAST (源碼掃描):** 檢查程式碼是否有漏洞。

      - **SCA (相依性掃描):** 檢查使用的第三方套件是否有漏洞。

      - **DAST (動態測試):** 模擬駭客攻擊。

      - **Penetration Test (滲透測試):** 若為**對外服務 (Public Facing)**，此項通常是**強制要求**。

- **\## 注意事項**

   - **安全性是設計的一部分，而不是事後補救**。所有安全相關需求都應在專案初期就納入範疇與預算。

   - 對於安全相關問題，「否」通常不是一個可接受的答案，除非有正式的風險接受程序 (Risk Acceptance)。

---

## 7\. 基礎設施設計 / 網路考量 (Infrastructure Design / Network)

- **\## 範疇**
   專案的「**骨架與血脈**」🏗️。確保系統的部署環境具備高可用性 (HA)、災難備援 (DR) 能力，並且網路頻寬足以支撐。

- **\## 填寫者**
   **基礎設施架構師 (Infrastructure Architect)** 與 **網路架構師 (Network Architect)**。

- **\## 填寫指南**

   - **7\.1 (HA/DR):** 對於關鍵或對外服務的系統，必須設計 HA/DR 架構。需說明是 Active-Active 還是 Active-Passive，並規劃故障轉移 (Failover) 測試。

   - **7\.3.2 (Network Bandwidth):** 估算系統上線後所需的網路流量，並與網路團隊確認現有頻寬是否足夠，不足時需將升級成本納入預算。

- **\## 注意事項**

   - HA/DR 的設計等級應與**業務關鍵性 (Business Criticality)** 成正比。不是所有系統都需要最頂級的災備方案。

---

## 8\. 效能與容量規劃 (Performance and Capacity Planning)

- **\## 範疇**
   確保系統「**跑得動、扛得住**」💪。規劃系統的效能指標、壓力測試，並預估未來的容量需求。

- **\## 填寫者**
   **技術架構師**與**效能工程師 (Performance Engineer)**。

- **\## 填寫指南**

   - **8\.1.1 (Performance Requirement):** 需定義**具體的效能指標** (如每秒交易數 TPS、回應時間)，並規劃效能測試。

   - **8\.1.2 (Pre-production Site):** 效能/壓力測試**不應在正式環境 (Production) 進行**。需規劃一個與正式環境規格相近的預備環境 (Pre-production/Staging)。

   - **8\.2.1 (Capacity Planning):** 需根據預期的使用者增長、資料量增長，規劃未來 3-5 年的擴充能力。

- **\## 注意事項**

   - 效能測試應盡早規劃並納入專案時程與預算。等到上線前才發現效能問題，通常為時已晚。

   - 對於雲端方案，容量規劃應結合彈性擴展 (Auto-scaling) 的策略。
