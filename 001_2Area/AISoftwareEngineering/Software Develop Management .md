# Software Develop Management 

- Why：

   - 比較少開發外部產品，思考跟現在有什麼不一樣

   - 一樣可靠的條件下，更敏捷的開發速度

- 參考：無暇的程式碼-敏捷篇

- 敏捷是一種管理與組織的方法，因此，因應組織而調整至關重要

- 管理原則： 獲得實際成果來評估下一階段 勇氣，回饋，溝通，簡單 沒有人能獨佔程式碼，報表 測試覆蓋率是團隊指標，不是管理指標，因為太容易變成 KPI 化而搞鬼 結對對於知識傳達交流很重要，但是會花一些成本 應用完整的 The Circle of Life，否則敏捷只會有效的產生混亂程式碼

The whiteboard depicts a plan for implementing smart office software architecture.

Key points:

 \* Software Development Model:

   \* Emphasizes an iterative process with Azure DevOps.

   \* Integrates Copilot for code assistance.

   \* Leverages Databricks for data processing and analysis.

 \* Smart Office Software Architecture:

   \* Utilizes AUD Mesh for device connectivity and communication.

   \* Includes stations and an app store for software deployment.

   \* Integrates AI (Artificial Intelligence) at various levels.

   \* Edge computing is utilized for processing data closer to the source.

 \* Development, Testing, and Monitoring:

   \* Application Insights are used for log analysis and monitoring.

   \* Copilot assists with test case generation and code review.

Overall, the whiteboard outlines a comprehensive approach to building a smart office softw

are ecosystem.
