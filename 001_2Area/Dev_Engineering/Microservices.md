# Microservices

- [Even Amazon can't make sense of serverless or microservices](https://world.hey.com/dhh/even-amazon-can-t-make-sense-of-serverless-or-microservices-59625580?fbclid=IwY2xjawI92rhleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHWSZUtvDvKX8p7wIcZhQCvjYznds5UeOWTiN9XDDy-ZILqdKulR_FSFqzw_aem_LYjh2rBetlEb-EzBghNePA)

- The Prime Video team at Amazon has published a rather remarkable case study on their decision to dump their serverless, microservices architecture and replace it with a monolith instead. This move saved them a staggering 90%(!!) on operating costs, and simplified the system too. What a win!

- "We designed our initial solution as a distributed system using serverless components... In theory, this would allow us to scale each service component independently. However, the way we used some components caused us to hit a hard scaling limit at around 5% of the expected load."
